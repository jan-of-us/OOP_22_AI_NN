For example usage see [Implementation Examples](Implementation_Examples.ipynb)

## Features
* Classification and Regression using RandomForest or Neural Networks
* Plotting options:
  * Classification:
    * Confusion matrices
    * feature importance (random forest only)
    * training history (neural net only)
  * Regression
    * Model fit (y_train vs prediction on x_train)
    * Prediction
    * feature importance (random forest only)
    * training history (neural net only)
